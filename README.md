My notes on how to work with ArborXR

## Add devices to ArborXR

* Download the latest Device Setup App for <a href="https://graphql.xrdm.app/download/system-content/channel/58083799-49d1-47fe-8cfd-04cbe080b943">Windows</a> or <a href="https://graphql.xrdm.app/download/system-content/channel/c2c632ca-3890-42b5-b4c1-6bd20b01073e">Mac</a>
* Devices are shown in Devices & Groups > Ungrouped Devices

## Organization strategy

* Create group by Lab
* Create group by gruops of devices
* Create nested groups

## Create Groups

A Group acts as a container. Can be nested if nothing is set in parent group. Nested groups can represent an organization

* Add Group
* Drag and drop devices in created groups
